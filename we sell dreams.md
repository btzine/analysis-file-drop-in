in streetwear, what *is* the subject?

i'll preface this by clarifying where it is that i'm coming from: i'm a skateboarder and photographer/graphic designer with friends contributing to Supreme (and thus i'll use Supreme as a focal point).  i have experience both behind and in front of the lens as well as industry stuff.  i actually don't have much interest in streetwear.  but i do have great interest in philosophical theory, and so i'll bite.

the enterprise that is *streetwear*, is an exchange of *identity*.  in a system of economic liberalism, this translates to a *marketplace of identity*.  founder of Buzzfeed, Jonah Peretti, expands upon this in his essay entitled ["Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Contemporary Visual Culture and the Acceleration of Identity Formation/Dissolution."](http://www.datawranglers.com/negations/issues/96w/96w_peretti.html)

so now that we understand what the enterprise is, let's dissect what goes into crafting *identity*.  in graphic design we refer to these as *"identity systems"*.  identity is lifestyle: your surroundings, your behaviors.  in commodified form, it amounts to a flag of optics that consumers can wave as a means to express "this is *who i am*".  i can elaborate on the granularities of this, but i think what i've laid out should be a good enough basis.

now i'll explain what goes into making a Supreme video: first, you need the *hotspots*.  Bushwick, Echo Park, Mission.  think like a realtor.  second, you need the *aesthetic*.  in this case we'll use Strobeck's work, influenced by the cold intimacy of Nan Goldin, Dash Snow, etc.  for this reason we'll process the camerawork to emulate the blue/greens of Fuji film.  thirdly and perhaps most importantly you need a *model*.  the model must showcase the prevailing hip sensibility: in this post-postmodern era we're looking specifically for an oscillation between *sincerity* and *irony*.

now, slap the merchandise on the subject, boom.  profit.

and to clarify, this is not an attack on streetwear, Supreme or Strobeck.  i'm actually a huge fan and think that the creative playground that is *identity* is lovely.  all is of love.  and it always has been, especially while we all contribute to this fascinating culture that we've been building.

however, it seems that this cultural project is of no interest to you.  so, perhaps you'd be more interested in the amazon sales pictures: the merchandise, minus the identity.

streetwear isn't a game of *material* â€” it's a game of *ideal*.
